        10. ATM simulation
            Â· Write a program that simulates an ATM. The user can repeatedly withdraw an amount
            until the account is empty (account balance = 0). The initial account balance is e.g. 100 euros.
            Console example:
            Your account balance is 100 euros.
            Enter the amount you want to withdraw in EUR:
            Enter: 20
            You have withdrawn 20 euros. Your new account balance is 80 euros.
            ------------------------------------------------
            Enter the amount you want to withdraw in EUR:
            Enter: 90
            Your account balance is insufficient. You only have 80 euros in the account.
