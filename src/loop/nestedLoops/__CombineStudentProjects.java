    Task 3: Combine student projects
    Create a string array students with the names of 4 students (e.g. {"Max", "Anna", "Lukas", "Sophia"}).
    Use a nested for loop to find all possible pairs of students who could do a project together.

    Print each combination to the console (e.g. "Max and Anna").
    Example output:
    Max and Anna
    Max and Lukas
    Max and Sophia
    Anna and Lukas
    Anna and Sophia
    Lukas and Sophia
