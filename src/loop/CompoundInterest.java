        . Compound interest calculation over several years (for loop)
        Â· Write a program that calculates the final amount for a starting capital if it is compounded annually
         at a fixed interest rate. Calculate the amount for a period of years.

        Console example:
        Enter your starting capital in euros:
        Enter: 100
        Enter the interest rate in percent:
        Enter: 5
        Enter your savings period in years:
        Enter: 3
        At the end you have 150 euros (example value only)
